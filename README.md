# Guard::OCUnit [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ap4y/guard-ocunit.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ap4y/guard-ocunit)

OCUnit guard allows to automatically launch tests when files are modified.

* Compatible with XCode 4.x
* Tested with XCode 4.5.

## Install

Please be sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) installed before continue.

Install the gem:

```
$ gem install guard-ocunit
```

Add guard definition to your Guardfile by running this command:

```
$ guard init ocunit
```

## Usage

Please read [Guard usage doc](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme)

## Guardfile

OCUnit guard can be adapted to your projects.

### Standard Cocoapods project

``` ruby
guard :ocunit,
      :derived_data  => '/tmp/tests',
      :workspace     => 'SampleApp.xcworkspace',
      :scheme        => 'SampleApp',
      :test_bundle   => 'SampleAppTests' do

  watch(%r{^SampleAppTests/.+Tests\.m})
  watch(%r{^SampleApp/Models/(.+)\.[m,h]$}) { |m| "SampleAppTests/#{m[1]}Tests.m" }
end
```

Please read [Guard doc](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

## Options

By default, Guard::OCUnit will only look for test files within `Tests` in your project root. You can configure Guard::OCUnit to look in additional paths by using the `:test_paths` option:

``` ruby
guard 'ocunit', :test_paths => ["Tests", "/Models/Tests"],:test_bundle => 'SampleAppTests' do
  # ...
end
```

### List of available options:

``` ruby
:test_bundle  => '',         # test ocunit bundle with provided name, mandatory parameter
:derived_data => nil,        # build into provided path, default: current folder
:workspace    => nil,        # build provided workspace, default: nil, use with :scheme
:scheme       => nil,        # build provided scheme, default: nil, use with :workspace
:project      => nil,        # path to the project to test, defaults to current folder
:sdk          => '',         # link and test against provided sdk, default: 'iPhoneSimulator6.0'
:verbose      => false       # dump all tests information in console
:notification => false       # display notification after the tests are done running, default: true
:all_after_pass => false     # run all tests after changed tests pass, default: true
:all_on_start => false       # run all tests at startup, default: true
:keep_failed  => false       # keep failed tests until they pass, default: true
:tests_paths  => ["Tests"]   # specify an array of paths that contain test files
:focus_on_failed => false    # focus on the first 10 failed tests first, rerun till they pass
:clean        => false       # define all builds as clean. By default run all command doing clean build
